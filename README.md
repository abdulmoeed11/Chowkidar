# Chowkidar

Chowkidar is a mobile application that is used together with a Smart Lock System(Like Ring from Amazon) designed with RaspberryPi. This project was our Final Year Project and only has 1 demo user. The project can send images to Firebase backend which prompts the RaspberryPi, also monitoring Firebase, to run a Deep Learning model. The Lock can then be opened using the face of the person whose images were uploaded to Firebase. The application allows the user to open the Lock with a button on the application screen.
